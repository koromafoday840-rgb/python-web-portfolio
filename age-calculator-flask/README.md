#  Age Calculator (Flask)
**What I practiced:** Learning how to handle user input in a web app.

###  Logic
This project uses `try-except` blocks to make sure the app doesn't crash if someone types letters instead of numbers before performing calculations.

###  Manual Calculation
I manually tested the math (Current Year - Birth Year) with several different dates before writing the Flask route. This ensured that the logic was solid before I integrated it into the web interface.
