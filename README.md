# Learning Python through Logic & Trace Tables
I started this portfolio because I wanted to see if I could actually turn my math notes into working web apps. Python felt like the best place to start because of its logic

## 🛠️ Projects & Features
##  Project Highlights

* **[Age Calculator - Flask](./age-calculator-flask)**: I built this functional web app to practice handling user input and real-time calculations.

* **[Accumulator Logic Study](./accumulator-logic-study)**: I used this to master iterative state changes. It includes my handwritten notebook trace.

##  Organization
* **Modular Structure**: I organized my repository into dedicated project folders for better maintainability.
* **Practice Lab**: A space for my original exercises and daily coding challenges.
## Technical Skills
* **Languages**: Python (Logic & Flask).
* **Web**: HTML Forms, POST requests.
* **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Replit.
Logic & Debugging Process
I use Mechanical Execution Tracing to manually verify my code logic before building it.
