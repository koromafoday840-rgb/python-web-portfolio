# 🚀 My Python Web Portfolio
I built this repository to document how I'm mastering Python, from core logic to web apps. I believe in solving the math on paper before I touch the keyboard to ensure my code is bug-free from the start.

## 🛠️ Projects & Features
## 📂 Project Highlights

* **[Age Calculator - Flask](./age-calculator-flask)**: I built this functional web app to practice handling user input and real-time calculations.

* **[Accumulator Logic Study](./accumulator-logic-study)**: I used this to master iterative state changes. It includes my handwritten notebook trace.

## 📂 Organization
* **Modular Structure**: I organized my repository into dedicated project folders for better maintainability.
* **Practice Lab**: A space for my original exercises and daily coding challenges.
## 💻 Technical Skills
* **Languages**: Python (Logic & Flask).
* **Web**: HTML Forms, POST requests.
* **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Replit.
🧠 Logic & Debugging Process
I use Mechanical Execution Tracing to manually verify my code logic before implementation.
