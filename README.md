# 🚀 My Python Web Portfolio
Status: Beginner - Developing foundational skills in Python logic and Web Development with Flask.
Welcome! This repository tracks my journey from learning Python basics to building functional web applications.

## 🛠️ Projects & Features
* **Interactive Age Calculator**: A Flask web app that takes user input, performs typecasting, and returns calculated data.
* **Data Validation**: Python logic that demonstrates `try/except` blocks to handle input errors safely.
* **String Manipulation**: Practice with Python methods like `.replace()` and case sensitivity.

## 📂 Organization
* `main.py`: The primary web server and active project code.
* `practice.py`: A dedicated space for my "original work" and daily logic exercises.

## 💻 Technical Skills
* **Languages**: Python (Logic & Flask).
* **Web**: HTML Forms, POST requests.
* **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Replit.
🧠 Logic & Debugging Process
I use Mechanical Execution Tracing to manually verify my code logic before implementation.
